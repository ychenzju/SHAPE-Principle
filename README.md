# SHAPE-Principle
This repository provides the scripts to simulate single bubbles to explore the mechanisms underlying SHAPE technique.
The main script is population1.m, which simulates a probe-to-probe acoustic propagation model coupled with a bubble model, to generate the bubble's scatterd acoustic signal for further analysis. Periodogram, a method of power spectral density analysis, is used to extract the subharmonic amplitude from the acoustic signal. Subharmonic responses concerning bubble radius, pulse frequency and magnitude are analyzed and illustrated in figures.
Users can change the parameter setting provided in the script to explore how a bubble response to a specific excitation and bubble condition.
